Streamlit UI as D'app 
- presuming customer is logged in (with personal info such as delivery address etc built in & would have option of purchasing as guest in D'app.) 
This could be used as buttons for a visual effect.

Customers can search for things to purchase by seeing photos and descriptions.
Customers can convert crypto or cash for our coins in their wallet (input wallet id or from dropdown list) (enter value to exchange) and then use these coins to purchase the product, which comes with its own NFT.
This allows them to pay petrol for nft minting while remaining within the price range.
Coins are removed from the wallet, and NFT is added. 
Purchase approval. 

Backend Solidity ERC721 for NFT 'FASH' Solidity ERC20 coin (if not, ETH from Ganache would suffice).
