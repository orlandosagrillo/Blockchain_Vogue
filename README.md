This project offers a Streamlit-based user interface where users may select from a variety of options, and this software mints a Non Fungible Token with each physical product purchase. The NFT is subsequently sent to a wallet address specified by the user.  The customer can purchase designer goods directly from the Streamlit UI, and each purchase of a designer good generates a Non Fungible Token (NFT) as proof of ownership. The user-specified wallet address receives NFT transfers.

# Conceptualization

A prototype stage user interface for an anti-counterfeit tool has been created by fintech company "Blockchain_Vogue" to show the security and quality of life advantages it can provide. This kind of action can reduce the unlawful trade in counterfeit goods while simultaneously maximising revenues for the manufacturer of genuine high-end products in a global market that is always changing.

# Non Fungible Tokens in the Clothing Industry

The market for high-end luxury goods is expected to reach USD 419 billion in 2027 after growing at a CAGR of 3.7% from USD 349.1 billion in 2022. About 30 billion dollars are lost annually due to counterfeit goods, and using an NFT as evidence of purchase will make it more difficult for people to make money off of bogus goods. NFT will not only confirm the legitimacy of the goods but also present a fantastic opportunity.

## IPFS and Pinata

A content addressing process is used by the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), a decentralised peer-to-peer file sharing network, to identify each file in a global namespace in a unique way. On the IPFS network, Pinata provides NFT storage.
