This project provides a Streamlit-based user interface via which users may choose from a number of alternatives, and the software generates a Non Fungible Token with each physical product purchase. The NFT is then delivered to the user's wallet address. Each purchase of a designer good generates a Non Fungible Token (NFT) as proof of ownership. NFT transfers are delivered to the wallet address given by the user.

# Conceptualization

Fintech business "Blockchain_Vogue" designed a prototype stage user interface for an anti-counterfeit tool to demonstrate the security and quality of life benefits it can give. This type of action can help to limit the illegal trade in counterfeit goods while also increasing revenue for manufacturers of real high-end products in a volatile global market.

# Non Fungible Tokens in the Clothing Industry

The market for high-end luxury products is estimated to reach USD 419 billion in 2027. Annually, over $30 billion is lost due to counterfeit goods, and using an NFT as proof of purchase will make it more difficult for people to profit from phoney goods. NFT will not only certify the legality of the items, but will also give a tremendous chance.
